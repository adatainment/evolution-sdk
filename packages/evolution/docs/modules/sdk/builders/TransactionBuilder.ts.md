## TransactionBuilder overview

Transaction builder storing a sequence of deferred operations that assemble and balance a transaction.

Added in v2.0.0

## Execution Model

The builder pattern:

- **Immutable configuration** at construction (protocol params, change address, available UTxOs)
- **ProgramSteps array** accumulates deferred effects via chainable API methods
- **Fresh state per build()** — each execution creates new Ref instances, runs all programs sequentially
- **Deferred composition** — no I/O or state updates occur until build() is invoked

Key invariant: calling `build()` twice with the same builder instance produces two independent results
with no cross-contamination because fresh state (Refs) is created each time.

## Coin Selection

Automatic coin selection selects UTxOs from `availableUtxos` to satisfy transaction outputs and fees.
The `collectFrom()` method allows manual input selection; automatic selection excludes these to prevent
double-spending. UTxOs can come from any source (wallet, DeFi protocols, other participants, etc.).

## ReadOnlyTransactionBuilder (interface)

Transaction builder for read-only wallets (ReadOnlyWallet or undefined).

Builds transactions that cannot be signed. The build() method returns a TransactionResultBase
which provides query methods like toTransaction() but NOT signing capabilities.

This builder type is returned when makeTxBuilder() is called with a read-only wallet or no wallet.
Type narrowing happens automatically at construction time - no call-site guards needed.

**Signature**

```ts
export interface ReadOnlyTransactionBuilder extends TransactionBuilderBase {
  /**
   * Execute all queued operations and return a transaction result via Promise.
   *
   * Creates fresh state and runs all accumulated ProgramSteps sequentially.
   * Can be called multiple times on the same builder instance with independent results.
   *
   * @returns Promise<TransactionResultBase> which provides query-only methods
   *
   * @since 2.0.0
   * @category completion-methods
   */
  readonly build: (options?: BuildOptions) => Promise<TransactionResultBase>

  /**
   * Execute all queued operations and return a transaction result via Effect.
   *
   * Creates fresh state and runs all accumulated ProgramSteps sequentially.
   * Suitable for Effect-TS compositional workflows and error handling.
   *
   * @returns Effect<TransactionResultBase, ...> which provides query-only methods
   *
   * @since 2.0.0
   * @category completion-methods
   */
  readonly buildEffect: (
    options?: BuildOptions
  ) => Effect.Effect<
    TransactionResultBase,
    TransactionBuilderError | EvaluationError | WalletNew.WalletError | Provider.ProviderError,
    never
  >

  /**
   * Execute all queued operations with explicit error handling via Either.
   *
   * Creates fresh state and runs all accumulated ProgramSteps sequentially.
   * Returns Either<Result, Error> for pattern-matched error recovery.
   *
   * @returns Promise<Either<TransactionResultBase, Error>>
   *
   * @since 2.0.0
   * @category completion-methods
   */

  ) => Promise<
    Either<
      TransactionResultBase,
      TransactionBuilderError | EvaluationError | WalletNew.WalletError | Provider.ProviderError
    >
  >
}
```

Added in v2.0.0

## SigningTransactionBuilder (interface)

Transaction builder for signing wallets (SigningWallet or ApiWallet).

Builds transactions that can be signed. The build() method returns a SignBuilder
which provides sign(), signWithWitness(), and other signing capabilities.

This builder type is returned when makeTxBuilder() is called with a signing wallet.
Type narrowing happens automatically at construction time - no call-site guards needed.

**Signature**

```ts
export interface SigningTransactionBuilder extends TransactionBuilderBase {
  /**
   * Execute all queued operations and return a signing-ready transaction via Promise.
   *
   * Creates fresh state and runs all accumulated ProgramSteps sequentially.
   * Can be called multiple times on the same builder instance with independent results.
   *
   * @returns Promise<SignBuilder> which provides signing capabilities
   *
   * @since 2.0.0
   * @category completion-methods

   * Suitable for Effect-TS compositional workflows and error handling.
   *
   * @returns Effect<SignBuilder, ...> which provides signing capabilities
   *
   * @since 2.0.0
   * @category completion-methods
   */
  readonly buildEffect: (
    options?: BuildOptions

    SignBuilder,
    TransactionBuilderError | EvaluationError | WalletNew.WalletError | Provider.ProviderError,
    never

   * Returns Either<Result, Error> for pattern-matched error recovery.
   *
   * @returns Promise<Either<SignBuilder, Error>>
   *
   * @since 2.0.0
   * @category completion-methods
   */
  readonly buildEither: (
    options?: BuildOptions

    Either<SignBuilder, TransactionBuilderError | EvaluationError | WalletNew.WalletError | Provider.ProviderError>
  >
}
```

   * - Read datum values without spending the UTxO
   * - Share scripts across multiple transactions
   *
   * Reference scripts incur tiered fees based on size:
   * - Tier 1 (0-25KB): 15 lovelace/byte

## ProtocolParameters (interface)

Protocol parameters required for transaction building.
Subset of full protocol parameters, only what's needed for minimal build.

**Signature**

```ts
export interface ProtocolParameters {
  /** Coefficient for linear fee calculation (minFeeA) */
  minFeeCoefficient: bigint

  /** Constant for linear fee calculation (minFeeB) */

  // Future fields for advanced features:
  // maxBlockHeaderSize?: number
  // maxTxExecutionUnits?: ExUnits
  // maxBlockExecutionUnits?: ExUnits
  // collateralPercentage?: number
  // maxCollateralInputs?: number
}
```

Added in v2.0.0

## TxBuilderConfig (interface)

Configuration for TransactionBuilder.
Immutable configuration passed to builder at creation time.

Wallet-centric design (when wallet provided):

- Wallet provides change address (via wallet.Effect.address())
- Provider + Wallet provide available UTxOs (via provider.Effect.getUtxos(wallet.address))
- Override per-build via BuildOptions if needed

Manual mode (no wallet):

- Must provide changeAddress and availableUtxos in BuildOptions for each build
- Used for read-only scenarios or advanced use cases

**Signature**

```ts
export interface TxBuilderConfig {
  /**
   * Optional wallet provides:
   * - Change address via wallet.Effect.address()
   * - Available UTxOs via wallet.Effect.address() + provider.Effect.getUtxos()
   * - Signing capability via wallet.Effect.signTx() (SigningWallet and ApiWallet only)
   *
   * When provided: Automatic change address and UTxO resolution.
   * When omitted: Must provide changeAddress and availableUtxos in BuildOptions.
   *
   * ReadOnlyWallet: For read-only clients that can build but not sign transactions.
   * SigningWallet/ApiWallet: For signing clients with full transaction signing capability.
   *
   * Override per-build via BuildOptions.changeAddress and BuildOptions.availableUtxos.
   */

   * Optional provider for:
   * - Fetching UTxOs for the wallet's address (provider.Effect.getUtxos)
   * - Transaction submission (provider.Effect.submitTx)
   * - Protocol parameters
   *
   * Works together with wallet to provide everything needed for transaction building.
   * When wallet is omitted, provider is only used if you call provider methods directly.
   */
  readonly provider?: Provider.Provider

  /**
   * Network type for slot configuration in script evaluation.
   *
   * Used to determine the correct slot configuration when evaluating Plutus scripts.
   * Each network has different genesis times and slot configurations.

   * - `"Preview"`: Preview testnet
   * - `"Preprod"`: Pre-production testnet
   * - `"Custom"`: Custom network (emulator/devnet) - requires slotConfig in BuildOptions
   *
   * When omitted, defaults to "Mainnet".

# constructors

## makeTxBuilder

Construct a TransactionBuilder instance from protocol configuration.

The builder accumulates chainable method calls as deferred ProgramSteps. Calling build() or chain()
creates fresh state (new Refs) and executes all accumulated programs sequentially, ensuring
no state pollution between invocations.

The return type is determined by the actual wallet provided using conditional types:

- SigningTransactionBuilder: When wallet is SigningWallet or ApiWallet
- ReadOnlyTransactionBuilder: When wallet is ReadOnlyWallet or undefined

Wallet type narrowing happens at construction time based on the wallet's actual type.
No call-site type narrowing or type guards needed.

Wallet parameter is optional; if omitted, changeAddress and availableUtxos must be
provided at build time via BuildOptions.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare function makeTxBuilder<
  W extends WalletNew.SigningWallet | WalletNew.ApiWallet | WalletNew.ReadOnlyWallet | undefined
>(config: Partial<TxBuilderConfig> & { wallet?: W }): TxBuilderResultType<W>
```

# types

## ProgramStep (type alias)

A deferred Effect program that represents a single transaction building operation.

ProgramSteps are:

- Created when user calls chainable methods (payToAddress, collectFrom, etc.)
- Stored in the builder's programs array
- Executed later when build() is called
- Access TxContext through Effect Context

This deferred execution pattern enables:

- Builder reusability (same builder, multiple builds)
- Fresh state per build (no mutation between builds)
- Composable transaction construction
- No prop drilling (programs access everything via single Context)

Type signature:

```typescript
type ProgramStep = Effect.Effect<void, TransactionBuilderError, TxContext>
```

Requirements from context:

- TxContext: Mutable state Ref (selected UTxOs, outputs, scripts, assets)

**Signature**

```ts
export type ProgramStep = Effect.Effect<void, TransactionBuilderError, TxContext>
```

Added in v2.0.0

## UPLCEvalFunction (type alias)

**NOTE: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED** - Reserved for future UPLC evaluation support.

**Signature**

```ts
export type UPLCEvalFunction = (
  tx_bytes: Uint8Array,
  utxos_bytes_x: Array<Uint8Array>,
  utxos_bytes_y: Array<Uint8Array>,
  cost_mdls_bytes: Uint8Array,
  initial_budget_n: bigint,
  initial_budget_d: bigint,
  slot_config_x: bigint,
